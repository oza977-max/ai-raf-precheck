// data class, input data zone, AI model type... is not very business
// friendly, how will they know all this").
//
// The form previously exposed the engine's internal field names as labels
// and its raw enum values as options. Those are the canonical vocabulary
// (policy-schema.md §3.0) and must not change — they are what rules match
// on. So the fix is presentation-only: the values stay, the words the user
// reads become questions a front-office person can answer without a
// glossary. Rule 4 (cross-cutting.md §7) — no logic here, just strings.
//
// The technical term is kept in parentheses on each option so a risk or
// model-validation reader can still map an answer back to the vocabulary
// the policy and the verdict are written in.
